 # Car Washing system (Transforming Bits into Atoms)
 
 The purpose of this system is to automatically detect and wash the a car after it enters the washing bay. With surveillance from an office in another location.
 
 ## Sensors required
1. Weight Sensor (Determine size of the car)
2. Motion Sensor
3. Timer
4. Servo-Motor
5. Laser Moisture Sensor
6. Touch Sensor
7. Sound Sensor

## Output
1. Water Hose
2. Soap Hose
3. Scrubber
4. Blow Dryer
5. Emergency Button


## How it works
1. Once a car enters the washing bay, the TV would display an indication for the driver to inform suitable parking spot (center of the washing bay)
2. Upon entering the center, the car would have to fully come to a halt, activating the weight and motion sensor, closing the door in the process
3. The activation of both sensors would automatically turn on the washing process
4. Car wash process : Water (30secs) -> Soap (30secs) -> Scrubbing (2 revs) -> Water (30secs) -> Dryer (1min)
Timing of each washing cycle is dependent on the size of the car (determined by the weight sensors)
5. In case of an emergency or malfunction, an attendant will be notified and would halt the system via the emergency button (touch sensor). If not, the driver can sound his horn, stopping the washing system (sound sensor)
6. Once the washing process is completed (laster moisture sensor), the dryer would be activated
7. After the drying process is completed, a green light would appear, opening the door, allowing the driver to drive off
